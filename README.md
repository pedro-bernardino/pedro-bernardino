Hello, I’m Pedro, a Civil Engineer transitioning into the tech industry and turning my passion for technology into a full-time career as a Java Developer.

Self-motivated and adaptable, I’ve built a strong foundation in programming through self-learning and hands-on projects. My journey began with embedded systems using Arduino, then expanded into Python for data scraping and automation, Swift for iOS and macOS development, and server technologies like Proxmox and Docker for virtualization and containerization.

This diverse experience led me to pursue and earn the Oracle Certified Associate (OCA) Java SE certification, solidifying my skills in object-oriented programming and application development.

I’m now eager to contribute my problem-solving mindset and technical expertise to a dynamic team. With a passion for continuous learning and creating efficient, scalable solutions, I’m ready to take on real-world challenges and prove my ability to deliver impactful software.
